# phon
phon is a real-time collaborative synthesizer built with [audiolib.js](https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/audiolib.js) and node.js.
It was [created during node.js knockout 2011](http://nodeknockout.com/teams/orangutan-chimpanzee) by davidgovea and catshirt.

Phon's particle interactions are modelled with energy, momentum, and quantum mechanical phenomena in mind - diamonds represent higher energy states which particles may enter after high-energy collisions.

Development is planned to continue.

# Instructions
